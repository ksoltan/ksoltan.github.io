      caption: An existing 80-20 frame was transformed into a rack for securing instruments inside the van. The instruments needed to be removeable, isolated from vibration, and properly spaced.

      caption: Emergency hole punching saved these brackets when I realized they weren't symmetric on both sides of the instrument!

      caption: Air is sampled at the front of the van, routed through a roof inlet, filtered, and connected to each instrument. The exhaust air comes out towards the back of the van.

{% capture project_description %}
As a continuation of our <a href="{{site.url}}/experience/democratizing-aq.html" target="blank">capstone project</a>, I helped design, fabricate, and install parts to retrofit our van into a mobile air quality monitoring lab.
I also worked with QuantAQ to develop a prototype for a device to connect any reference instrument to their online platform. I used a test-driven approach to develop the firmware framework in C++.
