    caption: Floating with the wind, the jellyfish were like weather stations, reflecting the current environmental conditions, just as their activity is in real life.

    caption: The shadows created by the jellyfish looked even more life-like.

    caption: The largest jellyfish was urgently reinforced throughout its life.

    caption: Each jellyfish had a unique temper. The blue was the calmest.

    caption: Even lying on the ground, the mass of plastic and wire looked jellyfish-like!

    caption: The first iteration used sticks to create the frames, while the plastic was sewed piece-by-piece directly onto the frame.

    caption: In the next iteration, I enlisted help to sew plastic bags into large sheets that I then formed over the frames of wire.

    caption: The wireframes did not hold a perfect shape and bent themselves into amorphous blobs, surprisingly like jellyfish!

    image: /img/posts/jellyfish/tentacles.png
    caption: The tentacles are sewed strips of colorful plastic bags, with texture added by stretching the plastic different directions.

    caption: Storing the large masses of plastic turned out to be easy since the materials were fairly resilient.

    caption: A trusty ladder and climbing carabiners and knots were key in securing the jellyfish to trees.

    caption: For scale, even the smallest jellyfish was almost human length in diameter.

{% capture project_description %}
We do not notice the signs of climate change until they are at our doorstep. When jellyfish blooms began clogging filtration systems and negatively impacting the economy, suddenly, people were interested.
I wanted to create a different type of conversation about climate change by creating a speculative future where jellyfish physically invade our land territory.
Starting with the idea of creating a red tide of angrily flashing lights in a forest, I built three larger-than-life blobs out of sewn plastic bags and wire and wood-reinforced frames. With the help of the wind, they captured the graceful essence of real jellyfish, and even started a few conversations about what green spaces meant to students.
Talk to me about jellyfish! I have a slight obsession :)
