lead_text: 'Brechtel designs and manufactures aerosol measurement devices for atmospheric chemistry research applications. Think particle counters and air quality research.'
secondary_text: 'I automated the MCPC testing protocol and aerosol generation process, updated CAD drawings with proper dimensioning, redesigned the small dryer unit to be 3D printed and ran characterization tests using the HSEMS, analyzed data in Igor, and reported intial findings in the user manual. This small dryer was used for mostly UAV applications where a compact and light dryer is needed. I also introduced user research to the company and led user interviews, created mockups, and synthesized insights to inform the next-generation product design. I also created a prototype for instrument connectivity and a modern user interface.'
