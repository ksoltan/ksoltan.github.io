{% capture project_description %}
For our <a href="http://www.olin.edu/collaborate/scope/" target="blank">senior capstone project</a>, we partnered with <a href="https://www.aerodyne.com/" target="blank">Aerodyne Research Inc</a> and <a href="https://airportimpactreliefinc.org/" target="blank">AIRInc</a> to build a pilot network of low-cost air quality (AQ) sensors in East Boston. Our team focused on the software infrastructure for collecting, storing, analyzing, and serving the data to both the public and scientists. <a href="https://www.quant-aq.com/" target="blank">QuantAQ</a>, our liaisonâ€™s startup, is continuing the technical development of the project.
My role: Developed UX spec; Wrote embedded code to connect sensors and instruments to cloud; Designed public communication materials; Managed budget.
