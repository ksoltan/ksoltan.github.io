lead_text: 'Implemented an efficient path planning algorithm using Markov Decision Processes.'
secondary_text: 'With 10,000 states used to represent a map, our algorithm takes 25.5 seconds to solve for the optimal path (20% of the total time), compared with the 183 seconds (60% of the total time) it takes to use the python mdptoolbox implementation.'
