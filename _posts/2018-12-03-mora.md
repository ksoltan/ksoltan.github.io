    caption: Hall effect sensors were successfully integrated to get position feedback from the joints, significantly adding to the number of wires.

    caption: On final demo day, we had one robot attached to a power supply and another on battery power. Both had all other electronics on-board and used a foam float for buoyancy.
  - side: right
    image: /img/posts/mora/fish_guts.jpg
    caption: At the end of December 2018, MORA had all electronics on-board with a custom PCB, although we ran into some power issues. A better printing procedure gave our robot a much better finish as well.

    caption: Testing a tree-like fin to stretch a thin (~1.5mm) skin around an actuator. This design was too heavy to move.

    caption: The Frankenfish wiggle, demonstrating the potential for the two-part half skin mold. I ended up resorting to needle and thread to put the two parts together.

    caption: Working at relatively small scale, it is amazing how complicated it is to get something moving reliably!

    caption: The second multi-hinged skeleton iteration was twice as small as the intial proof-of-concept.

    caption: The hinges at the top and bottom secure the magnet in the middle of the coil to allow full rotation and maximum force.

    caption: Version 1 of MORA was meticulously designed to be fully defined by sketches in one part file. Each segment was then exported as a separate body.

    caption: Achieving buoyancy in an easily-manufacturable way took me through many paths, including injecting copious amounts of expandable foam.

  - side: right
    image: /img/posts/mora/test_v1_mora.jpg
    caption: MORA's motion was characterized by tracking blue pins along its spine. The tethers were attached to some foam to reduce their effect on the robot's motion.

    image: /img/posts/mora/video_testing.jpg
    caption: A fantastically improvised testing rig suspended a camera above an aquarium to record videos. They were subsequently processed in MATLAB to generate motion plots.

    image: /img/posts/mora/nemo_underside.jpg
    caption: MORA, Nemo-edition, began to feature some positional feedback using Hall effect sensors placed next to the coils. Plus, more members joined the team, bringing a burst of enthusiasm!

    caption: In our new goal of bringing all electronics on-board (as opposed to sitting in a box outside of the water), we would need to tackle miniaturizing this beast of a protoboard.

    image: /img/posts/mora/pcb.jpg
    caption: Electronics miniaturization was solved by creating a custom PCB board, just the shape that would fit inside of the body.

{% capture project_description %}
MORA is a robot designed to be small and low-cost for use in swarms. Swarms of these tiny robots could be used to study fragile ecosystems like coral reefs or fish's schooling behaviors. It's biomimetic design could enable it to blend in with the environment and harness the efficiency of fish's excellent swimming performance.
The initial phase of this project was started at Harvard's Self-Organizing Systems Research Lab in 2017. I participated in the Student Poster Competition at the IEEE/MTS OCEANS 2018 Charleston conference to present my work. In fall of 2018, I continued as the project manager. I also did some design work, check it out <a href="{{site.url}}/experience/mora-logo.html" target="_blank">here!</a>
