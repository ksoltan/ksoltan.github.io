    caption: My dream was to have MORA become a swarming platform that anyone could buy and play with. This is the first pass design for a box containing all of the necessary parts.
  - side: center
    image: /img/posts/mora_logo/box_v2.png
    caption: The first and second pass designs of the box, even when including more serious colors and specifications, made the robot look like a kid's toy.

    caption: I wanted a more sophisticated look for my robot fish and used CAD drawings, more muted colors, and Helvetica Thin font to achieve the desired effect for the final piece.

    caption: LEGO instructions inspired the first pass how-to guide for assembling the fish.
  - side: right

    caption: Using CAD drawings helped make the guide look more sophisticated, but it wasn't fully conveying all of the necessary information.

    caption: The final assembly document was inspired by the <a href="http://dl.djicdn.com/downloads/s900/en/S900_User_Manual_v1.2_en.pdf" target="_blank">S900 drone manual</a>. I love its clean but detailed look! Check out the assembly guide in full <a href="/files/posts/mora_assembly.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

    caption: For Olin's Expo, I wanted to create a poster illustrating the evolution of my robot that strayed from the classic scientific poster.
  - side: right

    caption: With the second pass, I wanted to create a clearer hierarchy of information, guiding the observer in how they should progress through the poster.

    caption: In the final version, I omitted the large fish, which played a lesser part in MORA's evolution, creating the right amount of space for the other fish models. The splashes of color really helped the poster come together. See it in full <a href="/files/posts/mora_poster_expo.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

    caption: Final poster for the OCEANS 2018 Charleston Student Poster competition. I really wanted to create something that challenged what a scientific poster is generally regarded as - sterile and inaccessible to the general audience.

{% capture project_description %}
<a href="{{site.url}}/experience/mora.html" target="_blank">MORA,</a> a miniature, biomimetic robot, and I spent a lot of time together. We traveled from a lab in Harvard to a new robotics lab at Olin to the OCEANS conference in Charleston. For all of the public appearances we had lined up, MORA needed an image, a brand.
In the wonderful class called Tell the Story of What You Make, I embarked on creating a story for my fish, creating a box, evolution poster, and assembly manual. These artifacts became both a documentation form and a style for my future work in writing a paper and creating a poster for a technical conference.
