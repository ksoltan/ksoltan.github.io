I designed a logo for the RFID Fish Tagging project in which we developed the first version of an app for collecting data about tagged fish. The video to the left chronicles the evolution of the logo.
Because our initial users would be in Hawaii, the app was named HI (Hawaii) Tag. The spots on the fish are the Hawaiian islands. The G in Tag is flipped to resemble a fish hook - to tag a fish, one must first catch it.
Note: This logo was created in Photoshop. I have since learned about the wonders of Illustrator and vector graphics :).
