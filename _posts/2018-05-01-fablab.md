{% capture project_description %}
Second-hand clothing creates a trading market of its own, generating revenue, jobs, and hurting local economies. We tackled the question of how to create an autonomous, sustainable, and beneficial clothing trade in Kenya?
Using techniques from biomimicry, we developed design principles, and translated observations in nature to applications in our system. Throughout our series of design reviews, I engaged in researching and applying biological strategies and created concept art and layouts for our final posters.
