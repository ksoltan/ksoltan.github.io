lead_text: 'The SREHD system is a robot that semi-autonomously detects mines and IEDs, removing soldiers from the dangerous and difficult job of doing this by hand.'
secondary_text: 'As an intern in 2018, I performed a combination of testing and hunting down the root causes of reported issues with several robots. Additionally, I redesigned the help user interface on the operator control unit, working to strike a balance between a helpful layout in the field and using the already developed features and aesthetic.'
