{% capture project_description %}
We designed a robot turtle with a terrarium in its shell that would take care of the plant inside. The project was inspired by Nemo's Garden, where plants are being grown underwater in huge domes called biospheres. Why not do something similar but on land? The domes reminded me of turtle shells, and thus Terrapin was born.
Our team of 5 worked for a semester to design a successful system, integrating both mechanical, electrical, and software components.
I worked primarily on the mechanical system, designing and fabricating the turtle, as well as documenting our progress. Please check out our website for more documentation!
