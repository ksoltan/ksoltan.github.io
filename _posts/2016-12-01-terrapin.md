    caption: The second iteration included increased weight on the front legs, friction on the feet, and reinforced linkages that were properly restrained to improve the motion.

{% capture project_description %}
Terrapin is a friendly robot turtle whose shell is a terrarium for a plant. It is charged with taking care of this plant by moving into and out of the light. The project was inspired by Nemo's Garden where plants are being grown underwater in huge domes called biospheres. The domes reminded me of turtle shells, and we thought, why not make a land version?
Our team of 5 worked for a semester to design a successful system, integrating both mechanical, electrical, and software components as part of our Principles of Engineering course.
I worked primarily on the mechanical system, designing and fabricating the turtle, as well as documenting our progress. Please check out our website for more documentation!
