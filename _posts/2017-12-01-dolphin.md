{% capture project_description %}
In Fundamentals of Robotics, we were tasked with developing a robot with a bio-inspired propulsion system. It needed to float just below the surface of the water and autonomously navigate between different colored buoys, going from one to the next in a user-defined sequence.
Our team of 5 chose to build a dolphin tail with a gear train that moved it up and down in a sinusoidal motion.
I worked on designing the turning mechanism (yaw) on the robot, assembled and helped waterproof the electronics system, and wrote the code base.
